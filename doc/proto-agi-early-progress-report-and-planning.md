# Proto-AGI early progress report and planning (2020-12-18)

Here's a sum-up of what's been done so far with ROCCA (formerly called
opencog-gym) and what remains to be done.  It is writen from the
perspective of Legacy OpenCog, even though likely a good portion of it
applies to OpenCog Hyperon as well.

ROCCA (for Rational OpenCog Controlled Agent) is a subproject of the
proto-AGI project that primarily focuses on achieving learning and
planning via reasoning, as well as making sound decisions.
Sub-symbolic integration is not a primary focus of this subproject but
the code and lessons learned certainly will be of value to such larger
endeavor, which will likely involve Hyperon.

## What do we have so far?

We have an OpenCog agent [[1]](#references), easily wrappable to any
synchronous gym-like environment (via Kasim's wrapper), that can:

1. Learn (via the pattern miner) cognitive schematics (i.e. predictive
   implications) with arbitrary pre/post contexts, and one or more
   actions.

2. Use these cognitive schematics as plans to make decisions in a
   trivial environment (chase a food pellet in a 2-square board).

## What are the current limits?

1. Consecutive lags in predictive implications and sequential ands are
   limited to one unit of time, i.e. can capture cognitive schematics
   such as:

     If context C is true at T, and action A1 is executed at T, and if
     action A2 is executed at T+1, then goal G is likely to be
     acheived at T+2.

   Arbitrary lags, for mining or else, are not currently supported.

2. Mining is probably inefficient due to having to use Naturals to be
   able to match lags between events.  For instance 3 units of time is
   represented as

   `(SLink (SLink (SLink (ZLink))))`

   Or a lag of 2 units of time relative to `(Variable "$T")` is
   represented as

   `(SLink (Slink (VariableNode "$T")))`

3. Another source of inefficiency is decision making.  Although it is
   considerably more efficient than learning/planning (for now done
   with the miner, then soon done with PLN as well).  Once plans are
   there, decision is relatively fast, though in the current setting
   still takes 3 seconds to select an action given 200 cognitive
   schematics to select from.  In comparision discovering these 200
   cognitive schematics takes over a minute.

4. And of course the whole thing is inefficient due to the lack of
   1. SpaceTime server or alike;
   2. ECAN (Attention Allocation);
   3. Ultimately, capacity to create/use abstractions for modeling and
      acting. Schematization/specialization, meta-learning, etc.

5. As of right now PLN is very underused.  For instance goals are
   not decomposed into subgoals.  To happen this requires futher
   development on temporal logic, currently in progress.

## What remains to be done?

1. Move from the simplistic Chase environment to Malmo.  According to
   Kasim the plumbing is ready.  Maybe for starter we could port the
   Chase env to Malmo.  Then, as Alexey suggested in [[2]](#references)
   we need to create high level actions, such as `goto(X)`, etc, as
   well as high level perceta, to increase the scale and complexity of
   the environment.

2. Introduce temporal deduction.  The agent should be able to chain
   actions sequences that it has never observed, but rather based on
   whether the post-context of some cognitive schematics matches with
   (implies or inherits from) the pre-context of another.  For that we
   need to implement a similar deduction rule as [[3]](#references)
   for predictive implications.  This is also required for decomposing
   goals into subgoals.

3. Support arbitrary (possibly continous) time lags.  The agent should
   be able to notice surprising combinations of events even if they
   are arbitrary temporally spaced. Of course some heuristics could be
   used to lesser their prior as the lag increases or is too distant
   from the "scale" of the events (a notion that remains to be defined
   but should be doable).  For that to happen it looks like we need
   two things:

   1. The pattern miner should handle time intervals, then the same a
      priori property [[4]](#references) can be used to prune the
      search tree with time intervals, the larger the time interval
      the more abstract the pattern.

   2. We likely need to represent the lag distribution, based on
      direct evidence or indirectly inferred.  One possibility would
      be to introduce a temporal truth value (as suggested in
      [[5]](#references)), using a distributional lag.  As of today
      the lag is represented in the temporal relationship instead, see
      [[6]](#references), which makes sense given the current limits
      as it allows to represent the same predictive implication with
      different lags, resulting in different truth values, but once a
      distributional lag is used there is no longer the need for it.
      Even the TV of an "eventual" predictive implication can be
      obtained by looking at the extremum the cumulative distribution
      function.  So that way only one predictive implication, solely
      determined by its pre and post contexts, is required.  Of course
      such distributional temporal truth value could inherit from a
      more general distributional truth value.

4. Improve temporal mining efficiency.  We could (with Legacy OpenCog
   in mind):

   1. Upgrade the pattern matcher to have queries like

      `(Get (AtTime A (Plus (TimeNode "1" (TimeNode "10")))))`

      be able to match

      `(AtTime A (TimeNode "11"))`

   In that case timestamps would still be in the atomspace, which is
   inheritantly inefficient, alternatively we could:

   2. Integrate the spacetime server or such.  Maybe the one in the
      spacetime repository would do, I haven't personnaly studied it.
      If so it would also enable efficient spatial mining.  Beside
      being more efficient it should enable more flexible matching
      involving time intervals (ultimately spatial intervals as well).
      This would however require to fiddle with the pattern matcher or
      the pattern miner to integrate that type of spacetime queries.
	  
   3. Maybe a clever use of atom values could be an option as well.

   Beside these "low level" improvements there are certainly a number
   of algorithmic improvements that can be done.  I have compiled a
   number of papers (that I haven't read, so possibly irrelevant) on
   the subject:

   - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03653.pdf

5. Improve decision efficiency.  The decision procedure (consisting of
   estimating the posterior of each cognitive schematic, followed by
   Thompson Sampling) is entirely implemented in Python, which partly
   explains its slowness (again, 3 seconds for 200 cognitive
   schematics).  Re-implementing in C++ or Rust could speed it up,
   however before that we want to optimize the algorithm itself, maybe
   introduce ECAN, filter by surprisingness and prior, etc.

6. Add ECAN support.  Being unfamiliar with ECAN's implementation I do
   not know the specifics of that tasks, beside of course the first
   step of getting familiar with it.

7. I have not mentioned reasoning and inference control because as of
   now PLN is only used very shallowly (to calculate TVs of predictive
   implications based on evidence).  More attention will be required
   once futher development has taken place on that front.  Likewise,
   honorable mention: MOSES.

8. Regarding concept creation, meta-learning, etc.  Beside being
   beyond the scope of such demo, we can probably start worrying about
   it when most of the improvements above have been done.  The idea
   yet is to record internal cognitive operations taking place during
   learning, planning, etc, discover patterns and plan internal
   actions (tweak this parameter, rewrite this rule, etc) that
   provably increase the likelihood of goal fulfillment.  This aspect
   is also important in order to take into account temporal contrains
   during the planning process. For instance if a goal must be
   acheived within 10s, then a crude flash meta-reasoning could take
   place to evaluate that reasoning for say 2s, then executing the
   resulting plan for the remaining 8s is likely to succeed.  By
   considering `planning` and `executing` as high level actions, it
   should be possible to do without much radical change I believe.

9. Last but not least we need unit and integration tests.
